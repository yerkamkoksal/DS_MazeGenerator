# Maze Generation and Path Discovery Project

## Overview
This project comprises two phases: Maze Generation and Path Discovery. Implemented in C++, it first generates mazes based on user input and then discovers paths from an entry to an exit point within a specified maze.

## Features
- **Phase 1: Maze Generation**
  - Generates multiple mazes based on user inputs for dimensions (M x N) and the number of mazes (K).
  - Uses a stack-based approach to knock down walls randomly and create a maze.
  - Saves each generated maze in a file named "maze_mazeID.txt".

- **Phase 2: Path Discovery**
  - Loads a specified maze and attempts to find a path from a given entry to an exit point.
  - Saves the discovered path to a file named "maze_mazeID_path_entryX=_entryY_exitX_exitY.txt".
  - Handles cases where no path is found.

## Compilation and Execution
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang).
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ [filename].cpp -o MazeProject
2. Run the executable:
   ./MazeProject

## Usage

The program will prompt for input values for both phases.
For maze generation, enter the number of mazes (K) and their dimensions (M rows, N columns).
For path discovery, provide the mazeID, entry (X, Y) coordinates, and exit (X, Y) coordinates.
